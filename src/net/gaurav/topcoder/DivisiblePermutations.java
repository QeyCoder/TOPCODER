	 * Problem Statement
	 * 
	 * We define a permutation of an integer N as an integer that has the exact
	 * same digits as N, but possibly in a different order. Two permutations of
	 * N are considered different if the numbers they represent are not the
	 * same. For example, the set of all different permutations of the number N
	 * = 313 is {133, 313, 331}.
	 * 
	 * Given a String N and an int M, determine the number of different
	 * permutations of N that are divisible by M.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Definition
	 * 
	 * Class: DivisiblePermutations Method: count Parameters: String, int
	 * Returns: long Method signature: long count(String N, int M) (be sure your
	 * method is public)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Constraints - N will contain between 1 and 15 non-zero digits ('1'-'9'),
	 * inclusive. - M will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
	 * 
	 * Examples 0)
	 * 
	 * "133" 7 Returns: 1 There are three permutations of 133 (133, 313, 331),
	 * but only 133 is divisible by 7. 1)
	 * 
	 * "2753" 5 Returns: 6 The permutations of 2753 that are divisible by 5 are
	 * 2375, 2735, 3275, 3725, 7235 and 7325. 2)
	 * 
	 * "1112225" 5 Returns: 20 3)
	 * 
	 * "123456789" 17 Returns: 21271 4)
